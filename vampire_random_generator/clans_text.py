"ventrue":"Ventrue are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Ventrue are not called the Clan of Kings for nothing. Carefully choosing their progeny from mortals familiar with power, wealth, and influence, the Ventrue style themselves the aristocrats of the vampire world. Their members are expected to assume command wherever possible, and they're willing to endure storms for the sake of leading from the front.\nTo them, they are the rightful heirs of power and command. The Ventrue have held more positions of power than any other clan; as god-kings in ancient Babylon to majority shareholders and campaign fund backers in the modern age, they've held their footing as long as they could. Though in recent nights their status has begun to slip, many Ventrue feel their time is running out and as their privileges slip through their fingers, most Ventrue tighten their grasp, willing to fight fang and claw to keep hold.\nClan Ventrue has long been the leader of the Camarilla, even after losing their most prominent representative, Hardestat, to a Brujah assassination. A majority of the clan believes that the strength of tradition and lineage is what holds them above the rest. Though these nights they are careful, blending into humanity behind the scenes. Resentment is building from having to control the strings from behind the curtain, but curtailing the Masquerade and possible breaches that would follow should they not is crucial.\nEven outside of business they function as if one. They are the establishment that so many aims to destroy. They set and maintain the rules, they punish those who do not keep them with the occasional treat for those who do. Those who do not like their methods call them tyrants for keeping Kindred down. However, without them, the Camarilla and in turn, the Masquerade would have fallen long ago.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Dominate is used to guide the masses they lead, be it Kindred or mortal. It also serves its purpose when hunting to force a mortal to show their neck or to protect the Masquerade in a situation gone wrong.\n- Fortitude keeps the Ventrue able to withstand the storms when their lesser fight against them. This power has its use for them to stand against adversity and feed, where others might struggle with blood, they take their fill.\n- Presence is the alternative to mind control. Used to sway their courts and loyal followers to adore them regardless of their less than ethical approaches. With their value of conservation, this aids them in easily finding prey to take their fill upon.\n\nBane:\n- Rarefied Tastes - When the Ventrue drinks the blood of a mortal who does not fall within their preference, they must spend Willpower equal to their Bane Severity else they will vomit the blood from their bodies unable to slake their hunger. Their preferences range within the clan, some looking for descendants of a certain nationality to soldiers suffering from PTSD. With a Resolve + Awareness test, they can sense if a mortal they seek to feed from fits within their preference. At character creation, their preference should be selected.\n- Hierarchy - The Ventrue suffer a penalty equal to their Bane Severity to their Discipline dice pools when using them against a vampire of a lower generation. They must also spend Willpower equal to this penalty if they wish to directly attack other vampires of a lower generation.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Arrogance - Fueled by the beast and their natural desire for power, the Ventrue must force someone to obey a command given. The order cannot be given through supernatural means such as Dominate. Until they satisfy the requirements, they receive a two-dice penalty for any actions not directly related to leadership.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Ventrue",

'tzimisce':"Tzimisce were introduced in the Vampire the Masquerade 5th Edition Companion Guide. The dragons view ownership above all, they aim to conquer and rule the subject of their possessiveness. Traditionally their charges were based on geographical locations, hence the stereotype of a vampire in a looming castle. However, in the modern age, the younger generations have taken a more loose approach, staking claim over mortals rather than their land. Their desire to own is only limited by their lack of expansion, but once they've sunk their claws in they are hard to shake loose.\nThese possessive traits extend beyond others and property and into their own body. Many dragons specialize in a form of Protean known as Vicissitude which allows them to alter their bodies how they deem fit, including the bodies of others willing or not. These Tzimisce go beyond just the physical perfectionism and lean into the metaphysical and stretch the very limits of vampirism itself. Transforming their bodies into statues, or altering the traits of gender, reaching as far as to create groups of mortal lookalikes to subsume their individuality. Some tales even speak of Dragons going as far as to become one with their haven, merging into the soil of their domain.\nThis, of course, creates a divide between the older and younger Tzimisce where the younger have had less time to cultivate their ownership while the other doubles their control. It's no surprise to hear that the Tzimisce were active participants in the Anarch Revolt and were one of the founding clans of the Sabbat. Even tonight, with the Sabbat shattered, others are wary of them and their cunning abilities. With the elders controlling so much, many younger members are driven from the Black Hand and towards the Anarchs to redefine themselves and their charges. A few Tzimisce find comfort within the Camarilla, finding a familiar comfort in its neo-feudalism even if the tower itself has little love for them.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Animalism allows them to extend their oneness with their domain, as well as extend their command over the lesser beasts in their territory.\n- Dominate enables them to enforce their edicts through mental force.\n- Protean has its purpose beyond changing into animal shape. Growing alongside their ability to Dominate they unlock their ability to use Vicissitude.\n\nBane: \n- Grounded - Each Tzimisce must select a specific charge, be it physical location, a group of people, or something even more esoteric. Each night they must sleep surrounded by their charge, if they do not, they sustain aggravated Willpower damage equal to their Bane Severity upon waking the following night.\n- Cursed Courtesy - If they wish to enter a place of residence uninvited they must spend Willpower equal to their Bane Severity, this penalty also applies to their Discipline pools while they are there. The invitation inside can only be made by someone who lives there and this does not occur in uninhabited homes or public places. Tzimisce with this Bane cannot take the uninvited Folkloric Block.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Covetousness - When afflicted with this compulsion they become obsessed with owning something in the scene, be it an object, or property to a living person. Whatever it is, they must add it to their collection and any action taken not towards this purpose incurs a two-dice penalty. This penalty continues until ownership is established or the object of their desire is unobtainable.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Tzimisce",

'tremere':"Tremere are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The arcane Clan Tremere were once a house of mortal mages who sought immortality but found only undeath. As vampires, they've perfected ways to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world. Their power makes them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Auspex allows the Tremere to perceive the truth from their surroundings, hunting down hidden objects and communicate long distances with others without fear of being heard. When in a pinch they use this power to find a pliable victim to feed from.\n- Dominate gives the Warlocks the ability to do anything for knowledge and get away with it. Theft, betrayal, and anything else with lesser ethics are easily covered by manipulating the minds of others. They show little remorse when using this power to feed as well when needed.\n- Blood Sorcery grants them the ability to release devastating attacks against their foes, protecting themselves in turn and ease feeding. Some Thaumaturgy uses this power to sap the blood from a mortal's body without physical touch. This expertise in unlocking the secrets of blood makes them a valued if not mistrusted member of the Camarilla.\n\nBane:\n- Deficient Blood - Before the fall of Vienna, they were defined by their rigid hierarchy of Blood Bonds within the Pyramid. After the fall, their Blood weakened and rejected all prior connections. Tremere are unable to Blood Bond other Kindred, though they can still be Bound by other clans. Tremere can still Blood Bond mortals to do their bidding, but the vitae must drink an additional amount of times equal to their Bane Severity.\n- Stolen Blood - When performing a Blood Surge they need to make Rouse Checks equal to their Bane Severity. If these Rouse Checks increase their Hunger to 5 or higher, they can choose whether to back off their Blood Surge or perform it to then hit Hunger 5 afterward immediately.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Perfectionism - Nothing but the best will satisfy them, anything less than exceptional still instills a profound sense of failure. When afflicted by this, the Warlock suffers a two-dice penalty to all dice pools. The penalty is reduced to one die when actions are being repeated and removed entirely on a second repeat. This does not end till they managed to score a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene ends.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Tremere",

'toreador': "Toreador are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. Known for their seductive nature, enthralling demeanor, and eloquent grace to the point of obsession, Toreador vampires Embrace artists and lovers into their ranks, forever trying to stir their own deadened hearts. Supernaturally graceful and charming, the Divas are always looking for the next thrill, leaving a detritus of discarded lovers and victims in their wake.\nA clan who exudes beauty, one who seeks out the aesthetics in life and holds their obsessions with it. However, it is a mistake to think of them as nothing but Divas and perverts. Beauty is power and the way they utilize love to influence those around them to do just about anything is an invaluable weapon. The elders of their clan stress that the Embrace must be given to those worthy and that the clan seeks out pioneers of different arts. The clan prospers when it's filled with fresh ideas and those who value experimentation and discovery of new aesthetics. Because of this trait, this clan is riddled with a wide range of artists. However, to the Toreador, art is not only done with paint or a pencil.\nActors, singers, poets, and more fill in their ranks as long as they are viewed to be bringing something new to the table. And although they seek out the best of the best, it's not unheard of for one of the Hedonists to embrace another in a moment of weakness and haste. Creating a subpar childe after the pool of blood that they died in was too beautiful to let them go. Still, the clan holds its diversity between talent, beauty, and other core traits their sire found as an asset.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Auspex allows the Degenerates to find mortals that possess exquisite experiences for them to try as well as seek out other Kindred and cater to their desires or antagonize them with truths the Toreador shouldn't know.\n- Celerity is used by the Toreador to aid in their craft and while they may claim they are not fighters, they have been known to strike their foes before they were even able to react. In feeding, they use this power to take their blood before a mortal has even realized what occurred.\n- Presence is the power which they have mastered, using it in conjunction with Auspex to pierce and manipulate the minds of mortals and Kindred alike. Be it to engage in carnal pleasures or to take their fill of blood.\n\nBane:\n- Aesthetic Fixation - A desire for beauty takes control over the Toreador and when in lesser surroundings they suffer. When they are within settings they find less than beautiful, they take a penalty equal to their Bane Severity when using Disciplines.\n- Agonizing Empathy - Whenever their feeding causes Aggravated damage to a mortal, the vampire suffers the same damage in return but cannot receive more than their Bane Severity. This damage is generally Aggravated. The damage itself is reflected as vivid bruising wherever they bit their victim as internal bleeding takes place.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Obsession - Utterly obsessed with a single thing, the Toreador cannot speak of anything but that object. Be it a person, a piece of artwork, a blood splatter in the right lighting, or the sunrise itself, they cannot take their attention from it. Any other actions receive a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion lasts until they can no longer perceive the object or the scene ends.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Toreador",

'thin blood': "Thin-bloods are neither entirely vampire nor mortal, the ever changing nature of the Duskborn evokes pity, jealousy, and fear in equal measure. Considered little more than trash by most vampires, the thin-bloods are banding together, leveraging their resistance to sunlight and the strange, mercurial adaptability of their powers against their oppressors.\nThey are clanless and not considered a clan by most Kindred, as they are the result of embraces too far from the progenitor, Caine. Created by the arrogant Kindred who believed to be closer to the potentiator than they were, a victim of a murder and the guilt forced the hand of a Kindred to embrace or just an experiment of a Tremere gone wrong. The thin-bloods are a high-generation group, often cast out and shunned by Kindred society. Viewed as a threat to the Masquerade, many will destroy them if given the opportunity. Thin-bloods can be of any mortal origin and are not affected by their sire's bloodline.\nIn 2009 the Inner Circle of the Camarilla issued an edict that all Thin-bloods must be branded. A task accomplished by a Tremere tattoo artist or even scorched into their skin using the sun. Even Anarch and Autarkis will think twice before mingling with a branded thin-blood.\nThrough rumors and stories, there are tales of thin-bloods finding a way out. Even if they do not age, eventually they must decide to remain within the night or adapt to their new lifestyle and remain in the sun. Diablerie is the first choice, upon taking the soul of another vampire they join their clan and inch closer to Caine. Removing all Thin-blood traits and characteristics as they become a fully-fledged vampire. Sometimes this is rewarded as a prize to those who show themselves capable to the tower and sometimes this is a spur-of-the-moment decision against a Kindred who has been left vulnerable by others. The other choice is that of a way out, stories of those who have returned to the sun and become mortal once more. The stories usually entail thin-bloods clinging to their humanity and ending their sire. But then again, any mortal who knows about Kindred is a threat to the Masquerade and must be taken care of.\n\nCharacteristics:\n- Resting in the Generations from 14th to 16th, they lack the Blood Potency to use most vampiric powers and instead must use their ways to survive. Their human-like traits allow them to take less damage from the sun and some may even walk in it without harm. Their distance from Caine has prevented them from succumbing to frenzies and they remain almost lifelike compared to most vampires. However, the negatives outweigh the cost. This distance also removes their ability to learn and master Disciplines, instead only able to utilize them if their Blood flows with the proper Resonance from their last feed. They are also weaker than the average Kindred and take damage as if they were still mortal. Due to their Blood Potency of 0, they cannot create Blood Bonds nor Embrace with any certainty, only able to ghoul a mortal for the duration of one night with enough Blood.\nThin-Bloods, unlike the rest of the clans they do hold a unique trait. Known as Thin-blood Merits and Flaws, they can be curated by the player to pick and choose different advantages and weaknesses unique to only them and create the perfect almost vampire. See Merits and Flaws.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Thin-bloods created the art of thin-blood alchemy, granting them the potential to create new and replicate existing Disciplines from vitae and other sources. The Merit Thin-blood Alchemist can be taken at Character Creation to begin with level 1 in the Discipline and one formulae, however, if it is not taken they can still traverse Alchemy at the in-clan experience rate.\nWhenever they feed from a Resonance, they are granted one dot and one power in a Discipline tree associated with the Resonance. If the Resonance is Intense or stronger, they gain an additional dot in conjunction with a second power. This, however, is only temporary as the rating cannot be increased with experience points and is lost upon hitting Hunger 5 or the next feeding. With the thin-blood Merit Discipline Affinity, they are able to select one Discipline and traverse the tree as if a True Kindred.\n- Thin-blood Alchemy is created from the thin vitae only thin-bloods possess.\n\nBane:\n- Thin-bloods do not suffer from a Bane unless the thin-blood Flaw Clan Curse is taken.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Thin-bloods do not suffer from a clan Compulsion.\n\nFinde more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Thin-blood",

'salubri':"Once known for their wisdom and knowledge, the clan barely exists these nights now. Their legacy is one of tragedy and a painful lesson of the eternal struggle. Their childer are few in the modern night; as per their customs they generally only embrace once they've reached Golconda, even though this is only speculation given the current state of Kindred affairs. The choice of a childe for the Salubri is an intensely personal decision in comparison to other clans. They usually desire those with inquisitive behaviors and personal struggles within them. Salubri rarely embrace on a mere whim. Choosing a childe who has a problem which they must then solve for themselves, be it terminal illness or an unquenchable drive to right a wrong done to them.\nIt is believed that Saulot, their progenitor, was devoured by a Tremere to strengthen his own clan's Blood. It is also believed that Saulot was the first Kindred to ever reach Golconda and so his lineage still attempts to walk in that same path centuries after his death. More often than not, the Salubri lead troubled lives only burdened more by the eternal life they've been given and a third eye, which each Salubri has. Still, they persevere to solve the mystery of Caine's damnation and help others find their salvation. However, the power to help comes with the power to harm and many Kindred believe in the rumors of these Cyclops being able to steal their souls. Some Salubri even taking a hard stance of desiring to destroy those too entangled with their beast or keep their distance from other Kindred has done nothing but solidify the speculations about them.\nVery few domains allow them within the walls because they are running into trouble with others, neither Camarilla Princes nor Anarch Barons are willing to keep them long. Many of the Salubri are still being hunted for actions of their sires centuries ago. Their fate in the modern night is grim, still, they face this adversity with a perspective rare within Kindred. Willing to help others walk the difficult path of Golconda, plenty of Salubri seems to be wanting to help others than cause strife. Others seek to protect them in other ways by hunting down wights and other low humanity monsters that plague Kindred to cause nothing but problems.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Auspex enables the Salubri to perceive what's hidden in the world and reveal the truths. With the strength of Dominate, they've managed to turn this power to into something of a balm for another Kindred as well.\n- Dominate is used to unburden others of the horrors Kindred experience or to erase the memories of atrocities Kindred commit.\n- Fortitude has aided the Salubri in surviving the endless hunts against them as well as developing the power in a way to aid others.\n\nBane:\n- Hunted - Their vitae has a unique trait where when another clan partakes in their Blood they find it difficult to pull away. Once a non-Salubri has consumed at least one Hunger level worth, they must make a Hunger Frenzy test at difficulty 2 + the Salubri's Bane Severity (3 + the Salubri's Bane Severity for Banu Haqim). If they fail, they will continue to consume the Salubri until pried off. Additionally, each Salubri has a third eye and while it's not always human-like it's always present and cannot be obscured by supernatural powers. In addition to this, whenever they activate a Discipline, the eye weeps vitae with its intensity correlating to the level of the Discipline used. The Blood flowing from the eye can trigger a Hunger Frenzy test from nearby vampires with Hunger 4 or more.\n- Asceticism - Whenever their Hunger is below three, the Salubri suffer a penalty equal to their Bane Severity to any Discipline dice pools. The bleeding third eye still remains.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Affective Empathy - Overwhelmed with empathy for a personal problem of someone else, any action not taken to help the person mitigate the suffering they take a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion continues until the sufferer's burden is eased, a more critical problem arises or the scene ends.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Salubri",

'ravnos': "Ravnos are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. Masters of misdirection, the Ravnos prefer not to fight or bleed for something they can obtain through subtler means. They can charm and vanish within the same mortal breath, and those once fooled quickly learn to question their very senses when in the company of Ravens. Always on the move, the Ravnos can never rest in the same place for long lest their curse light them on fire as they slumber.\nThey were almost annihilated during the beginning act of the Gehenna War during the Week of Nightmares but with time is now growing stronger once more.[2] They may be known as wandering Kindred, those utilized to bring messages or as those who wish to do nothing else but mess with the minds of others. Generally they move across the lands, rarely settling down in attempt to remain one step ahead of the judgement that runs through their veins. Their methods are not usually those of brute force, gaining adoring fans or overdrawn plans that take centuries to complete. Instead most Ravnos rely on their wits, clever charm and illusions. They prefer not to bleed when able, using more subtle methods to obtain whatever it is they desire. For this reason it is rare they make their true nature known and once they have, they disappear into the night as quickly as they appeared.\nIn order to combat this curse, those that do remain within certain regions do well to set up multiple havens and don multiple masks. No clan is as skilled as the Haunted when it comes to blending into society, be it mortal or Kindred. Due to the mistrust they may face, some display themselves as Caitiff in order to find a place within Kindred society, but those who do not and show their true colors often take an Autarkis standpoint and sell their services to others. Maintaining this, however, is difficult and most eventually pack up and leave either due to a collection of enemies or the doomed blood burning them as they rest.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Animalism is the reason most Ravnos maintain a good relationship with animals, employing them as spies, distractions or just as company while on the road.\n- Obfuscate allows the Daredevil to disappear from sight when things aren't working out, but it also allows them to create and manipulate their hallucinations. Combined with Presence, this allows the Ravnos to utilize this power at it's limit.\n- Presence is saved for when natural charm just doesn't cut it. They may frequent use of this power in order to find victims in a pinch.\n\nBane:\n- Doomed - Anytime they daysleep within the same place more than once in seven nights, roll a number of dice equal to their Bane Severity. If they receive any 10's they then take 1 Aggravated damage for each as they are scorched from within. What constitutes as the same place is defined by the chronicle, but generally will need a mile distance between the two resting places before the bane is triggered. Mobile havens do work as long as the haven is moved a mile away. Due to this, the Ravnos may not take the No Haven Flaw.\n- Unbirth Name - If a Ravnos unbirth name is used against them, the name-wielding opponent receives a bonus equal to the Ravnos Bane Severity to resist their Discipline powers. Additionally, the Ravnos affected receives the same penalty to resist supernatural powers used by the opponent.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Tempting Fate - When faced with their next problem, the Daredevil must attempt the solution with the most dangerous or daring of actions, anything less incurs a two-dice penalty. Context appropriate flashy or risky attempts may even net bonus dice. They are free to convince others to follow them in their actions but may as well go it alone. This Compulsion persists until the problem is solved or further attempts become impossible to accomplish.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Ravnos",

'nosferatu': "Nosferatu are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Nosferatu wear their curse on the outside. Their bodies horribly twisted and deformed through the Embrace, they lurk on the fringes of most cities, acting as spies and brokers of information. Using animals and their own supernatural capacity to hide, nothing escapes the eyes of the so-called Sewer Rats.\nTheir Embrace is one of the most painful, twisting and deforming their body into something else forever to be stuck as a monster. The entire transformation process can take weeks and result in deformities similar to birth defects, growths, severe injuries, or, sores; leaving the unlucky as hideous monsters or normal looking humans with conditions. Regardless of their monstrous appearance, they are often some of the most compassionate kindred from wearing their curse on the outside rather than inside. To blend in some will use their abilities within Obfuscate or heavy make-up and prosthetics. Some believe that when trouble is about to come knocking, it's best to slink down into the underground and sewers to avoid detection. Sending others to report into the tower rather than face the Camarilla themselves and be caught out by the hunters storming or being faced by their beautiful counterparts.\nThe Second Inquisition have noted that this clan lingers around social outcasts, building rapport with them and earning their compassion in trade to better hide from the hunters. The Nosferatu have taken to communicating via codes and dead languages through several sources to not be tracked after the fall of their ARPANET station, SchreckNET.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Animalism serves a purpose as a way to increase the Nosferatu's reach with spying, as well as sending swarms to attack their opponents. It also assists the Sewer Rats with feeding as it's easier and arguably more ethical to summon and drain an animal than stalk a mortal to feed from.\n- Obfuscate has mixed opinions in the clan as some are proud of their ghastly appearance. Regardless of the controversy, it is an exceptional tool when feeding.\n- Potence is a valuable tool in rapidly neutralizing foes in their path. Being able to hit and run a vessel for blood or incapacitate a pursuing enemy as they flee. Many Scabs will think twice before using it in front of mortals as it may expose their deceptions.\n\nBane:\n- Repulsiveness - Cursed by their blood, when they are Embraced they are twisted into revolting monsters. They can never raise their rating in the Looks merits and instead must take the (••) Repulsive flaw. Any attempt to disguise themselves incurs a penalty equal to the character's Bane Severity, this also includes the use of Disciplines such as Mask of a Thousand Faces. However, most Nosferatu do not breach the Masquerade by being seen, they are instead perceived as gross or terrifying.\n- Infestation - The Haven of a Nosferatu is always infested with vermin, any attempt to do something that requires concentration takes a two plus Bane Severity penalty, as well as the same penalty to social tests at ST discretion. Additionally, when a Nosferatu spends a scene at an enclosed location, the vermin appears and causes the same penalty though reduced to equal only the Bane Severity. Any attempt to control these vermin with Animalism is done at a penalty equal to Bane Severity.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Cryptophilia - Consumed by a hunger for private secrets, the Nosferatu seeks to obtain knowledge no matter big or small as long as it's not a well-known bit of information. During this, they also refuse to give up their secrets except in strict trade for something greater than their own. Any action not actively working towards gaining them a secret they take a two-dice penalty. This Compulsion does not end till they learn a secret they deem to be useful, sharing this secret is entirely optional.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Nosferatu",

'ministry':"The Ministry are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Ministry always has something to offer. This often cult-like clan recruits those able to employ temptation as a weapon. They Embrace those with the will and means to sway, entrap, and ultimately liberate their targets from whatever they seek: the victim's possessions, allegiance, or even faith. To the Serpents, everything has a price.\nThe clan was formerly known as the Followers of Set. For as much as a cult as they are a clan, the majority of their members adhere to a disruptive system of beliefs. They are known as as a group of the devious type, tricksters, tempters and liars. Due to this their relationships in the modern age and in the past are rocky at best, given their tendencies to play all sides during major conflicts. Their entry into the Camarilla was rejected, leaving most to side up with the Anarchs.\nWith the creed not forced upon their childer, that does not stop their lineage from influencing them and enticing them to gravitate towards the propensity for subterfuge and attraction.\nMany of the clan keep vast libraries, making a nightly hunt to gather ancient documents or artifacts to study and bring to the cult. While others take a less direct route to liberate subjects on a more personal level rather than religious. Time is no matter to them, as often they'll wait months in order to properly sink their claws into their target with all the right forbidden vices.\n\nDisciplines:\n-Protean allows the minister to change their body's form, be it to extend their fangs or turn into an animal. They often take the form of a snake over a wolf.\n- Obfuscate is the reason Ministers are able to melt into shadows or vanish from plain sight. They use this power to discover the beliefs, creeds or other information of those around them to then later weaponize it against them.\n- Presence when used by the Ministers is a powerful tool to both attract and repel their victims. Used in both swaying a large congregation towards their whim or finding a lone person in need of some help.\n\nBane:\n- Abhors the Light - When a Minister is exposed to direct illumination, be it naturally caused or artificial, they receive a penalty equal to their Bane Severity to all dice pools while subject to the light. They also add their Bane Severity to Aggravated damage taken from sunlight.\n- Cold-Blooded - They can only use Blush of Life if they have recently fed from a living vessel in the same scene or up to roughly an hour ago, Storytellers discretion. When they do so, it requires a number of Rouse Checks equal to their Bane Severity rather than just one.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Transgression - The Minister suffers a burning desire to influence those around them to shatter the chains of their own making. They suffer a two-dice penalty to all dice pools that do not relate to enticing someone or themselves to break a Chronicle or personal Conviction. The Compulsion ends once the Minister causes someone, or themselves, at least one stain.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/The_Ministry",

'malkavian':"Malkavian are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. Derided as Lunatics by other vampires, the Blood of the Malkavians lets them perceive and foretell truths hidden from others. Like the “wise madmen” of poetry their fractured perspective stems from seeing too much of the world at once, from understanding too deeply, and feeling emotions that are just too strong to bear.\nTheir Embraces come from all walks of life and age, with most Embraces carries something that was only visible to the sire. One the gifts sought is called the 'Second Sight' or, the ability to understand dreams, perceive spirits or predict the future to some successful degree. The second gift is that of 'insight', otherwise known as someone who is highly empathetic up to finely-tuned knowledge of a subject. Due to this many of the clan come from professions in academics or doctors. Lastly, they hold interest in those they deem 'broken' by traumatic events. Due to these traits and their general instability, most Kindred never feel comfortable around a known Malkavian, often viewing them as unpredictable who is rarely worth the effort.\nSome Children of Malkav claim that there is a common trait they all share. Believed to be connected through a psychic link, a wavelength of sorts called the Cobweb or more recently titled the Network.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Auspex enriches their senses in order to play on their victim's weaknesses.\n- Dominate gives them the power of Dementation, utilized by the Malkavian to drive others mad.\n- Obfuscate remains a discipline they do not advertise, but gives them the ability to traverse unseen when desiring information or blood.\n\nBane:\n- Fractured Perspective - When suffering a Bestial Failure or a Compulsion, their mental derangement comes to the forefront. Suffers a penalty equal to their Bane Severity to one category of dice pools (Physical, Social or Mental) for the entire scene. The penalty and nature of the affliction are decided between the player and Storyteller during character creation.\n- Unnatural Manifestations - Using Discipline powers within close proximity of mortals scares them and any social interactions other than Intimidation suffer a dice penalty equal to their Bane Severity. This is not Masquerade-breaking, but the dislike remains for the duration of one scene. Other vampires subject to this recognize the Malkavian as a vampire but suffer no penalty.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Delusion - Whether it's figments of their imagination or extrasensory perception of the truths. For one scene, the Malkavian suffers a 2 dice penalty to rolls involving Dexterity, Manipulation, Composure, and Wits. As well as rolls to resist terror Frenzy.\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Malkavian",

'lasombra':"Lasombra are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. Creatures subtly at odds with mundane reality, Lasombra vampires are expected to triumph at any cost. Ruthlessness is a sought-after trait in progeny, making their reputation as betraying interlopers well deserved. Most do not seek attention, preferring to act as puppeteers, powers behind the proverbial throne. To a Shadow, the ends justify any means.\nThe Lasombra rarely have time for the weak, with a perspective that the only way to survive is to excel. Sympathy and morality do nothing but weigh them down and prevent their inevitable climb to power. They generally Embrace those who fought against the odds and came out on top, those who survive dangerous situations or otherwise exemplify excellence. Their childer tend to be targeted towards those who are fit for something beyond mortal life, such as sociopaths, deviants or other scarred survivors. The Magisters also tend to lean heavily into organized religion to find their new prospective, however they are not looking for the truly faithful or depraved souls, instead they seek out those who arose to power in the church from a desire to have complete control. Priests, nuns, monks, vicars or rabbis who have used their congregation as a tool to bolster their power.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Dominate is the reason they are able to crush wills and command obedience, they will without hesitation use this power to feed.\n- Oblivion enriches their Blood and allows them to manipulate and control shadows around them.\n- Potence is the reason some Kindred are able to display such feats of strength unseen by man, however they do not generally use this to feed, instead using it to crush their enemies in demands of respect.\n\nBane:\n\n- Distorted Image - In reflections or recordings (live or not) the Lasombra appear to be distorted, those who know what vampires are know precisely what's going on, while others might be confused but know something is wrong. This does not however, hide their identity with any certainty and they are not likely to be caught more often on surveillance than any other Kindred. In addition to this, modern technology which includes making a phone call requires a Technology test at Difficulty 2 + Bane Severity as microphones struggle with them as much as cameras. Avoiding any electronic vampire detection system is also done with a penalty equal to their Bane Severity.\n- Callousness - Whenever making a Remorse test remove a number of dice equal to the Bane Severity. The dice pool cannot be reduced below 1.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Ruthlessness - The next time the vampire fails an action they receive a two-dice penalty to all rolls until a future attempt at the same action succeeds. This penalty applies to future attempts of the same action still.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Lasombra",

'hecata':"Hecata are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines, the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death. They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or worse. Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those who can summon and command the very spirits of the deceased.\nA clan steeped in death, they practice the arts of necromancy and communication with the dead. The clan tends to favour mortals either from their own mortal family or those with useful connections to other outside families. It is speculated that the reason all Hecata share the same Disciplines unlike their ancestors is caused by the unification of the necromantic bloodlines that formed clan Hecata and the destruction of so many Giovanni elders.\nAt Storytellers discretion, a few changes to the Discipline line up may be made depending on the character's bloodline either through replacement of a power with another or by offering a unique 4-dot merit to unlock a fourth in-clan discipline. The following changes may be made; Giovanni line may replace Auspex with Dominate, Samedi may replace Auspex with Obfuscate, Lamiae may replace Auspex with Potence and the Nagaraja may replace Fortitude with Dominate. Keep in mind the requirements for certain Amalgams should a player want them.\nWith the nature of their bane, the Hecata have developed methods to feed safely. Through blood bags and corpses or extracting blood from their victims without the use of their fangs. They have a habit of feeding on herds or from members of their own family, however this brings strife as resentment and fear builds between them. In more recent years, the clan has formed a unique bond with the Circulatory System, to obtain mute or comatose vessels.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Auspex is how the Hecata plan their moves and for this reason, they rarely strike on impulse.\n- Fortitude gives them corpse-like ability to absorb harm to their bodies, able to shrug off anything raining down upon them.\n- Oblivion allows them to communicate with and control the energies of death and of spirits. Through it's use they might question the dead or set them to attack a rival.\n\nBane:\n- Painful Kiss - Hecata may only take harmful drinks from mortals which result in blood loss. Unwilling mortals that are able to escape will make the attempt, even those who are convinced or willing must succeed in a Stamina + Resolve test against Difficulty 2 + Bane Severity in order to not recoil. Vampires who are willingly bit must make a Frenzy test against Difficulty 3 to avoid terror Frenzy.\n- Decay - Hecata suffer additional dots in Flaws equal to their Bane Severity spread as they see fit across Retainer, Haven, and Resources Flaws. These Flaws can either be taken at Character Creation or removed by paying twice the amount of Background dots. Additionally, any purchase of dots in these Advantages costs an additional amount of experience points equal to their Bane Severity.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Morbidity - The vampire must move something from life to death or vice versa, any action not taken to end or resurrect something suffers a two-dice penalty. The subject does not have to be a living thing and can instead be an object or more abstract such as ideas or conversation points. This Compulsion lasts until their manage to kill or return something to life.\n\nFind More:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Hecata",

'gangrel':"Gangrel are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. Often closer to beasts than other vampires, and so the Gangrel style themselves apex predators. These Ferals prowl the wilds as easily as the urban jungle, and no clan of vampires can match their ability to endure, survive, and thrive in any environment. Often fiercely territorial, their shapeshifting abilities even give the undead pause.\nGangrels are generally embraced from prospects who show the ability to survive and fighters. Due to this their customs encourage fights for dominance but not to final death as they push for a culture of healthy rivalry rather than taking competition personally. They are usually the outcasts of Kindred society, learning to live in undesirable areas and yet thrive without bending the knee to a Prince or Baron. Gangrels tend to care less about appearances and status than they do about action and accomplishments.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Animalism gives the Gangrel the ability to make an animal their companion.\n- Fortitude allows them to live their desires by traversing harsh landscapes or absorbing a rain of bullets.\n- Protean is something they are known to have mastery over. Giving them the ability to shape their body into that of something animalistic.\n\nBane:\n- Bestial Features - In Frenzy, Gangrel gains animalistic features equal to their Bane Severity. These features last for one more night afterward, each feature reducing one Attribute by 1 point. The Gangrel may choose to Ride the Wave in order to only have one feature manifest and only lose one Attribute point.\n- Survival Instincts - Subtract dice equal to the Bane Severity in any roll to resist fear Frenzy. The pool cannot be below one die.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Feral Impulses - Unleash the animal hidden in their Blood. This urges the Gangrel to regress into an animalistic state where speech becomes difficult, clothes become too constrictive and arguments and best settled with claws and teeth. For one scene the Gangrel suffers a -3 dice penalty to all rolls involving Manipulation and Intelligence as they are only able to speak one word sentences during this Compulsion.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Gangrel",

'caitiff':"Caitiff exhibit no discernable lineage, the Caitiffs are vampires without a clan. Distrusted by their peers, they are scorned because of their lack of lineage but also feared for their unpredictability. Jacks of all trades but masters of none, each Pander makes their own way in the society of the damned, free from ancestry and expectations both.\nRepresentative of vampires in their purest form, the Caitiff do not suffer from the lineage of their Blood. Due to this, they are usually cast out by their clans either from shame, envy, or fear. The Caitiff take their distance either in shame or pride, born from the unique traits missing from their sire's clan. Caitiff embraces are not always accidental, it's assumed that the clanless do not target mortals for the embrace, but that is incorrect. In the modern night, the panders are becoming an increasingly large force. As survivors, most do not gather together and without their binding blood, they are more individualistic than those within clans. The mortals they seek for the embrace are generally strong-willed or accustomed to hardship. Their position in Kindred society is the bottom of the rung after all, only above the Thin-blood who shouldn't have been created at all.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Caitiff have access to all Disciplines, but remember they are not considered in-clan even if taken at Character Creation. Additional purchases of Disciplines come at a cost of 6 times the level in experience.\n\nBane:\n- Outcast - Untouched by their ancestors, the Caitiff do not share a common Bane. The character begins with the Flaw Suspect (•) and they may not purchase positive status during Character Creation. The Storyteller may impose a 1-2 dice penalty to social tests against Kindred who know they are Caitiff. To improve a Discipline, the cost is 6 times the level of experience points.\n\nCompulsion:\nCaitiffs do not have a clan Compulsion.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Caitiff",

'brujah': "Brujah are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Brujah are a clan of radicals and troublemakers, Embracing those willing to put someone in their place if the situation calls for it. Most see themselves as warriors with a cause, and these Rebels are guided by their passions, strength, and dedication to their ideals — whatever those may be.\nBrujah are generally Embraced from the ranks of those who are sympathetic to those who do not back down. Seeking out others who question the status quo and welcome countercultures. From spirited fighters to critical thinkers, the clan is bolstered by their ability to withstand the storm and persevere through hardships. The Brujah are commonly misplaced as the street punks or anarchists who are looking for nothing but trouble. However, this is far from the truth.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Celerity allows the Brujah to strike fast and move even faster when the situation becomes too dangerous.\n- Potence gives them the strength behind their attacks, bolstering their swings and allowing them to use fists rather than words to sway.\n- Presence is never the last resort with a Brujah. Giving them an edge when attempting to use words rather than physical violence to make their point.\n\nBane:\n- Violent Temper - A rage is simmering in the back of the mind with a Brujah with the slightest provocation able to send them into a frenzied rage. Subtracts dice equal to the Bane Severity of the Brujah against Fury Frenzy.\n- Violence - When a messy critical occurs as the result of any Skill test, a Brujah vampire causes damage to the subject of their interaction equal to their Bane Severity, in addition to any other result of the Hunger dice. The type of damage is dependent on the situation either physical or mental. The damage is Aggravated unless the player spends a point of Willpower to turn it into Superficial.\n\nCompulsion\n- Rebellion - The Brujah craves to take a stance against those who represent the status quo. This does not relent until they have gone against orders, expectations, or changed someone's mind. During this Compulsion, they suffer a -2 to dice all pools.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Brujah",

'banu haqim': "Banu Haqim are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The Masquerade. The Judges of the Banu Haqim are torn between their hereditary thirst for vampiric Blood and their passion for justice. Stern adjudicators, they are fiercely devoted to upholding a moral code, and Embrace mortals capable of assessing and handling threats, enforcing laws and traditions, and punishing transgressors.\nRegardless of the individual Banu Haqim's stance, they all adhere to some type of strict code, be it blood laws, personal ethics, governmental or religious rules. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean they are free of self-interest, and often such codes of conduct are a self-regulation method to keep in check their desire for Kindred blood. The Banu Haqim's instinct to find the guilty is intrinsic to the Blood and not bound by religion; those guilty of whatever transgression a Child of Haqim deems unforgivable must be punished, and punishment might even include taking their unlife from their veins through diablerie. They are also not tied to a specific cultural or geographical background, and modern Banu Haqim hail from all over the world, representing various beliefs. Their individual code is also not necessarily tied to a faith, and may come from personal convictions rather than religion.\n\nDisciplines:\n- Blood Sorcery is used to poison their blades and use their blood as a weapon against others, as well as sift out the truth in blood. They keep their secrets of Blood Sorcery close.\n- Celerity gives them to ability to move and react more quickly than humanly possible, allowing them to make judgement calls without the hesitation of thought.\n- Obfuscate is how they melt into shadows and disappear when needed. An useful Discipline for those times when they wish to witness a crime without being spotted before casting their judgement.\n\nBane:\n- Blood Addiction - When the Banu Haqim slakes at least one Hunger level from another vampire, they must make a Hunger Frenzy test at difficulty 2 plus Bane Severity. If they fail, they must gorge themselves on vitae, in turn opening the door to possible Diablerie.\n- Noxious Blood - The Blood of the Banu Haqim is toxic to mortals, but not to other vampires. Due to this mortals receive Aggravated Damage equal to the Bane Severity of the vampire for each Rouse Check's worth of Blood consumed. Their Blood cannot be used to heal mortal injuries. In amounts below the amount needed to Blood Bond, it does not harm them, even if directly injected into them.\n\nCompulsion:\n- Judgement - Urged to punish a wrongdoer, the vampire must slake one Hunger from anyone that acts against their own Convictions. Failing to do so results in a three-dice penalty to all rolls until the Compulsion is satisfied or the scene ends. Should the victim be a vampire, the Bane applies.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Banu_Haqim",

'mortals': "Mortals are the people that inhabit the world that vampires lurk in, the people that society is built for as technology continues to advance and brings them closer together. They have an endless amount of resources thanks to this, making living as vampires that much harder. Their airports scan luggage with the ability to notice that there might be a corpse in that shipping container and not what the manifest listed, they are connected through social media and other platforms to share information and perhaps rally against the creatures in the night. Mortals serve as a key element in World of Darkness and using them as a focus in stories, about their lives and who they are, can amplify the aspect of personal horror for players. Many Kindred, either through a spiralling Humanity, a naivety, or something else see them as nothing more than food to be preyed upon and when they do create relationships with mortals, they are the ones who set the terms.\nFrom the moment a mortal drinks the vitae of a vampire they become a ghoul, starting a process that simultaneously makes them more and less than they originally were. Ghouls are often taken as retainers in cases where their loyalty is required regardless of the Masquerade, especially as Kindred can Blood Bond as many ghouls as they can effectively manage. Unlike the vitae used in the Embrace or Blood Bonds, the Blood retains its ability to ghoul a mortal when stored for a few days in an airtight container away from sunlight.\n\nOne Rouse Check worth of vitae grants the mortal, or animal, the following benefits for roughly one month.\n\n- The mortal gains the first dot of a Discipline known by the vampire, called a domitor, and the one level 1 power the domitor possesses.\n- If a ghoul uses a power above level 1, they will take 1 point of Aggravated Health damage rather than making the Rouse Check.\n- Their aging process stops, sometimes even bringing the clock back a few years.\n- Wounds heal twice as fast, unless caused by fire.\n\nBut be warned that when weaning a mortal off this Blood, besides the side effects of the possible withdrawal from it's euphoric rush, that the years lost from the aging process being stopped will catch up to the mortal and rapidly deteriorate them.\n\nFind more:\nhttps://vtm.paradoxwikis.com/Mortals_and_ghouls",
