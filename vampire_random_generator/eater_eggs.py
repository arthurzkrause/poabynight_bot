    'vampire':"We don't use the word 'Vampire'! What are you, an animal? No, you are a Kindred! A Kindred! Moderate your language!",
    
    'camarilla':"Camarilla? The Camarilla no longer exists! 2022 was the last year it existed in Porto Alegre. Do you know why?  Tell me, I want to know. They say the wizards messed up one of their charms and something happened. Do you know something?\nBut until we get answers:\n\nThe Camarilla is one of the most organized and influential Kindred organizations in history. Their goal is to preserve the masquerade and keep Kindred in line with rules that help protect their society from the prying mortal eye. Beyond this, it is a conspiracy to help elders preserve their power built on an undead secret society that influences global business and politics. The Camarilla is the closest thing they have to a system of government and an international union of cities. It is completed by an inner circle and its Justicars and Archons that roam the world to 'keep the peace'. A fierce moral stance is held on preserving humanity even against the impulses of the Blood, seeing themselves as shepherds to the herds of mortals they blindly control. Many Camarilla members have a wealth of power and money, on top of their age and the inclusion of Anarch defects joining their ranks makes the sect distinctly upper class.\n\nPredominate clan alignments: Banu Haqim, Lasombra, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere, Ventrue.",

    'anarchy':"They say that the Anarchy exists, that it surrounds humans as a helping hand,  an image to worship. But like every youth movement, perhaps it has died in oblivion. Decimated by her own sins.\n\nOriginally called the Anarch Revolt, this sect is as old as the revolution against the Camarilla itself. In recent decades it has seen vast growth as younger kindred find it increasingly difficult to understand why they must follow the laws of elders who care nothing for them, but to throw them in harms way when needed. All vampires who fall outside of the Tower's control are considered 'unbound', and the Anarch movement is a small but visible subsection of the unbound who, rather than hide, have decided to fight back. They fight to claim territory from those who oppress them, as the ancient hands that held onto it are disappearing due to the Beckoning or other outside forces.\n\nPredominate clan alignments: Brujah, Gangrel, The Ministry, Caitiff (sometimes).",

    'sabbat':'The Sabbat are monstrous creatures; vampire supremacists who see themselves above mortals and do not care for them. They are a sect that evokes fear at its mention with their ideologies being met with loathing. The Sword of Caine wages a war against the Antediluvians, a Gehenna War, seeking to claim revenge for Caine and the ancient betrayal done to him by his childer. Their goal is to destroy the Antediluvians and subject the mortal world to a world with vampires at the top.\nIn their effort to make themselves the ultimate predators they have ironically shackled themselves to the beast. The sect deindividualized, indoctrinated, and collectively Blood Bound each cainite in an effort to make fanatical members of their organization. With all that said, the Sabbat are far from a monolith. With many faces and takes on inhumane, it is easy to run into a variety of cainites from faction.\nThe Sabbat has shrunk in size in recent nights compared to the others. Due to the Lasombra exodus, the fierce Second Inquisition targeting from their breaches, the Anarchs and Camarilla willingness to combine efforts against the Sabbat, and with high Final Death rate due to the Gehenna War the sects find many sources of peril in modern nights. Even then the challenge only enhances their fervor.',

    "diablerie":"I am disgusted that you would even think of searching for this term.\nDiablerie is an act condemned by most of us, as it involves not only drinking another vampire dry, but also consuming his soul, his essence, his consciousness. It is such a nefarious act that it corrupts you, that it leaves you visible to those who have Auspex, with dark spots in your aura. But since you're interested, I'll teach you.\n\nTo commit diablerie, you restrain the victim in some way and drink them, the greatest pleasure you will feel in your life. Once the prey is exhausted, you can attempt to commit the ultimate blasphemy and take their soul. It is a contest against taking upon oneself one's own nature and power; If you succeed, the diablerie begins and, at this cost, by gaining power, you lose Humanity, getting closer to the beast. If you fail, you will be one step closer to Final Death, after all, you fought with your own soul.\n\nFirst step: Strength + Resolve (Dif. 3) sometimes the number of Blood Potency\nSecond step: Humanity + your own Blood Potency vs. Resolve + Victim's Blood Potency.\n\nMake the most of your exp.",
    
    'humanity':"We are monsters. We are monsters to the point of creating a scale to measure our humanity. The most interesting thing is that on a scale of 0 to 10, most Kindred stabilize at grade 5, neither beast nor human. They say we start with 7, but who am I to question the humanity of a body that is still warm, that is nourished by the sun and smiles when the day is over. We are monsters, regardless of this classification, and even the holiest can be morally corrupt (this one's for you Salubri).\nAs we get older, time corrupts us and connections with life are lost when everyone we know is dead. When we see, a corpse is just another corpse and thus, we go down a step in humanity.",
    
    "final death":"It's your second death. It's your real goodbye. But don't be scared, you've already died as a human, now as Kindred, but there's still one more death to go. When everyone who once knew you forgets who you are.",
